# React.js With Mosh

React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive User Interfaces.

It is build by a FaceBook software engineer Jordan Walke.

Initial release to the Public (version 0.3.0) was in July 2013. React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.

## How React Works

When a webpage is loaded in a browser, the browser takes the `HTML` and forms a tree like structure `Document Object Model` or `DOM` which then allows us to use `javascript` and change the page content based on user interactions. e.x: we can use `js` to hide an element when a button is clicked

```js
// Vanilla JavaScript
const btn = document.querySelector("#btn");
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const div = document.querySelector("#div");
  div.style.display = "none";
});
```

as our application grows, dealing with the `DOM` cab become quite challenging and complex, and here is that `React` shines. With `React` we don't need to worry about querying and updating `DOM` elements ðŸ˜Ž.

instead we describe the webpage as a group of small, reusable components and `React` takes care of creating and efficiently updating `DOM` elements.

so `Components` help us write **reusable**, **modular** and better **organized** code.

## Structure of a React App

Essentially a `React` app is a tree of components with the `APP` being the root, bringing everything together.

## Folder Structure in a React App

1. `node_modules`: where all dependency packages are installed.
2. `public`: where our app's public assets like **images**, **icons**, **video** files and etc. goes.
3. `src`: where all the our components and sub-components go.
4. `index.html`: a very basic **HTML** file with a **div** with id of **root** and a **script** mapped to our **main.tsx** file. the main entry point to our application. here we can change the **title**, **favicon** and **meta-data**.
5. `package.json`: where all the information about this project is stored, like **name**, **version**, **author**, **dependency packages** for development and production, **scripts** for running specific files/tasks.
6. `tsconfig.json`: configuration options for `TypeScript Compiler`, we don't need to touch it in most of the times.
7. `vite.config.ts`: configuration options for `Vite`, we don't need to do anything with it in most cases.

## Create a React Component

There are 2 ways to create a React component:

1. `class components`: old and not used as much these days.
2. `function components`: new and quite popular. considered best practice.

with `JSX` we can write dynamic content.

```jsx
// PascalCase
function Message() {
  const name = "John";

  // JSX: JavaScript XML
  // return <h1>Hello World</h1>
  // we can write any JS statements inside {} "a statement is a piece of code that produces a specific value"
  //   return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;

  // or render elements conditionally
  if (name) return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
// export as default
export default Message;
// or
// export as named
export { Message };
```

## How React Works

![virtual dom](<./Screenshot%20(160).png>)
Currently we have a component tree with the `App` component being the `root` or `top level` component and `Message` being the `child` component, when the app start React takes that component tree and builds a JavaScript Data-structure called `Virtual DOM` which is different than the `Browser DOM`,

![component tree](<./Screenshot%20(162).png>)

it is a light-weight in-memory representation of the component tree in which each node represents a component and it's properties, when the `state` or data of a component changes React updated the corresponding node in the `Virtual DOM` to reflect the new changes.

![component tree](<./Screenshot%20(161).png>)

then it compares the current version of `Virtual DOM` with the previous version, to identify the nodes that should be updated, it will then update those nodes in the `Actual DOM`/`Browser DOM`

in fact updating the `Browser DOM` is not done by React itself! but with a dependency package `react-dome`

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App.tsx";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

## React EcoSystem

Since React is just a library and not a framework like Angular or Vue, and `Libraries` tend to be smaller and focused on specific tasks, while `Frameworks` are larger and provide a more complete infrastructure for application development, we often
need other tools for concerns such as routing, state management,
internationalization, form validation, etc.
